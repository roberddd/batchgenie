Hello, I'm Roberd, a seasoned photographer based in Sweden with a passion for digital art. With over 20 years of experience in photography, my journey into the world of digital art began as I started experimenting with various graphic software tools along the way. In 2015, I discovered Blender and was captivated by its versatility and power. It quickly became my go-to tool for satisfying my creative needs, offering endless possibilities for creating complex 3D art and animations.

After years of working with Blender and performing the same repetitive tasks with materials and other assets, I grew tired of the inefficiency. Unable to find existing addons that met my specific requirements, I decided to take matters into my own hands and create my own. BatchGenie was born out of this necessity, designed to address the challenges I faced in managing assets efficiently within Blender. Now, I'm excited to share BatchGenie with fellow Blender enthusiasts.
