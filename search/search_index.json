For more information on supported formats, see the Blender documentation.</p> </li> </ul> Material Name Settings <ul> <li>Folder name as the material name: If <code>enabled</code>, the name of the folder/subfolder will be used as the material name for textures found inside that folder. For the root folder: if only one texture set is found, the folder name will be used; if multiple texture sets are found, the folder name will not be used and the names will be derived from the texture filenames.   If this option is <code>disabled</code>, the material name will be derived from the texture filenames</li> <li>Use Title Case: Formats material names using Title Case, where each word starts with an uppercase letter and the remaining characters are lowercase (e.g., <code>example name</code> becomes <code>Example Name</code>).</li> <li>Split CamelCase names: Splits names such as 'MetalBronzeWorn' into 'Metal Bronze Worn'.</li> <li>Remove Underscore &amp; Dashes: Replaces <code>_</code> and <code>-</code> in the material names with a space.</li> <li>Resolution Suffix: Choose whether to add or remove texture resolution suffixes (e.g., 1K, 2K, 4K) from material names.<ul> <li>Add: Automatically appends the texture resolution to the material name, e.g., 'Oak Bark 4K', derived from the Base Color image. Skips adding the suffix if the material name already has one. <p>Note: this function increases processing time during import since it needs to check the resolution of the images. Additional time per material: 0.2 ~ seconds.</p> </li> <li>Remove: Removes resolution suffixes from material names if they are present. Supports both space-separated and underscore-separated suffixes (e.g., 'concrete_plaster_2k')</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Remove Fab.com ID: Texture sets downloaded from Fab.com often include an ID in the name, such as <code>concrete_plaster_rfxxf0_2k</code>, where <code>rfxxf0</code> is the ID. Enabling this option removes the ID to simplify and declutter the name, resulting in <code>concrete_plaster_2k</code>. Note that this function depends on the JSON file that comes with the texture set being present and only works when you have one texture set per folder.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove Keywords: These keywords will be removed from the names of the imported materials. Enter one or more keywords separated by spaces. The process is case insensitive. There are two replacement modes with different behaviors:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Loose Mode: Uses regular expressions to match and remove keywords as standalone words. This mode removes keywords that appear as isolated words, considering word boundaries.</p> </li> <li> <p>Strict Mode: Performs direct name replacement for each keyword. This mode removes the exact keyword from the name but does not alter any surrounding characters or delimiters.</p> Examples <p>Keyword <code>png</code>:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Loose:</p> <ul> <li>For the name <code>Bark 4 png</code>, the function will remove 'png', resulting in <code>Bark 4</code>.</li> <li>For the name <code>Bark_4_png</code>, no change will occur, as 'png' is part of a compound name with underscores, resulting in <code>Bark_4_png</code>.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Strict:</p> <ul> <li>For the name <code>Bark 4 png</code>, the function will remove 'png', resulting in <code>Bark 4</code>.</li> <li>For the name <code>Bark_4_png</code>, the function will remove 'png', resulting in <code>Bark_4_</code>. The underscores before 'png' will remain.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> Asset Tags <ul> <li>Add resolution Suffix as Asset tag: Similar to the above, but instead of modifying the material name, it applies the resolution as a tag to the Asset. This works only if 'Mark as Asset' is enabled. <p>Note: this function increases processing time during import since it needs to check the resolution of the images. Additional time per material: 0.2 ~ seconds.</p> </li> <li>Import Fab.com Tags: If the texture-set is downloaded from Fab.com, it typically comes with a JSON file containing metadata such as tags and the texture-set ID. Enabling this option imports this metadata and adds the ID and Tags as asset tags to the material. Note that this option does NOT fetch metadata from the internet. Additionally, this only works when there is one texture-set per folder, and requires that the <code>Mark as Asset</code> option is enabled.</li> </ul> Texture Detection <ul> <li> <p>Texture Detection: Edit the tags used for detecting different texture types during import. These tags, which are case-insensitive and separated by spaces, help BatchGenie automatically recognize and categorize textures.</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>DirectX Detection: Specify keywords to automatically detect DirectX normal maps. If a DirectX normal map is found, a converter node is added to transform it to OpenGL format, which Blender uses. Enter one or more case-insensitive keywords separated by spaces.</li> </ul> Normal Map Conversion Example <p></p> </li> </ul> Asset Previews <ul> <li> <p>Use Existing Preview: Use existing preview images if available, providing a faster alternative to generating new previews. Search for images containing the word 'preview' in the texture set's folder to use as the material's Asset Preview (requires 'Mark as Asset' to be enabled). This allows using existing previews if available, providing a faster alternative to generating new ones. If 'Generation during import' is also enabled, existing previews take priority over newly generated ones. This works best when each texture set is stored in its own folder.</p> Example of 'Use Existing Preview' <p>A texture set with a preview image included and how it looks inside the Asset browser once imported.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Generation during Import: Controls whether Asset Previews are automatically generated during the texture import process. Options include:</p> <ul> <li>Low Quality: Uses Blender's default Asset generation function for fast, but lower-quality previews.</li> <li>High Quality: Uses the add-on to create high-quality previews during import. See the <code>Render Asset Previews</code> tab in the add-on panel for settings.</li> </ul> <p>Note on automatic generation</p> <p>Enabling this feature may significantly increase processing time and affect stability, especially with a large number of textures.

However, with default settings, most Asset Previews should render in around 1 second.</p> <code>Can I add custom lights to the Lighting Setups?</code> <p>Yes! The list can be expanded by directly adding your own HDRIs to Blender via <code>Preferences &gt; Lights &gt; HDRI's</code> which makes them available in this list.</p> <code>I'm having slow rendering speeds in Cycles. What can I do?</code> <p>Besides adjusting the sample settings under the render settings in the BatchGenie panel, consider tweaking the following settings in Blender\u2019s default <code>Render</code> tab in the Properties panel. These settings are copied from your scene when rendering:</p> <ul> <li>Decrease the light paths under <code>Render &gt; Light Paths</code>.</li> <li>For volumes/VDB rendering, check <code>Render &gt; Volumes</code> and adjust the <code>Step Rate Render</code> and <code>Max Steps</code>. Increasing the <code>Step Rate Render</code> can significantly speed up renders. For Asset Previews, setting <code>Step Rate Render</code> to 5 or higher can halve render times compared to the default 1, without losing visible detail at that scale. If you're rendering for external use, you may need to balance the minor loss in detail against the improved speed.</li> <li>If using Adaptive Subdivision for models, adjust the <code>Dicing Rate Render</code> in your scene. Ensure the \"Experimental\" Feature Set is enabled under <code>Render &gt; Feature Set</code>. Then, increase the <code>Dicing Rate Render</code> value under <code>Render &gt; Subdivision</code>.</li> </ul> <code>I'm experiencing unusual behavior with object location when using the Studio Setups. What should I do?</code> <p>Try applying the Scale and Rotation transformations to your object(s).
